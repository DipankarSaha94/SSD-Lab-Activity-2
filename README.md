# Topic 
- IoV-SMAP: Secure and Efficient Message Authentication Protocol for IoV in Smart City Environment

# Theory Analysis
- Internet of Vehicles(IoV) in a smart city environment provides multiple benefits by controlling vehicle emergence, accidents, levels of pollution and trafic congestion. However communication among vehicles under IoV is susceptible to various security threats like impersonation, secret key disclosure, authentication and off-line guessing attacks.To prevent such attacks IoV-SMAP protocol has been introduced and as part of this assignemnt using AVISPA we are trying to validate all type of attcks it successfully prevents.

# Implementation Details
- The protocol works by registering vehicle with the help of smart card and authenticate the vehicle to vehicle communication using a Shared Secret key. So for simulation, we have created a vehicle role, vehicle server role and along with that a session in an environment has been created where two vehicles are communicating among each other. If any intruder is able to hack the shared key will be visible in the simulation which could possibly leads to an attack.
